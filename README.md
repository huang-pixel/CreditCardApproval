# Project Analysis 

## Objective

The purpose of this analysis is to illustrate the machine learning and data processing techniques learned in the project offered on the `Datacamp` website. I will use the Credit Approval Dataset which is a collection of credit card applications and the credit approval decisions. The data is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval). The implementation of the above technology consists of data visualisation, data transformation, logistics regression, decision tree. The procedure is organised as follows: 

	UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms.

- Generate data visualisations to understand the baseline data
- Develop research questions on data
- Convert data as required
- Generate and apply models to answer research questions
- Fine-tune model parameters to find the best model performance
